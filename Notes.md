## Notes 

- In Microservices, services can communicate with each other synchronously or asynchronously

    - Synchronously via axios/fetch and is done when your service cannot proceed further without getting a response
    - Asynchronously is done via queues/message broker(RabbitMQ,BullMQ,kafka,Redis)
